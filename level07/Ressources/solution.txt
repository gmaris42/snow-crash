When we do a ls, we can see there is a program called 'level07'.

If we execute it, it just display: level07

Using strings on it, (strings level07) we can notice it uses the getenv function to get an env variable called LOGNAME.
Then we check this variable using the comand env

LOGNAME=level07

We can presume that the program just print this env variable. 
So to exploit this weekness we just do:

export LOGNAME="\`getflag\`"

(\ because ` is a particular character and is needed to be executed)
