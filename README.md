Objectives
This project aims to make you discover, through several little challenges, cyber security
in various fields.
You will use more or less complex methods that will give you a new perspective on
IT in general.
You will reach some stalemate during this project. You will have to surpass them
yourself. You must be the one and ONLY key to the locked doors you will face. This
project aims to develop some logic thinking you will learn for good and use in the future.
Before asking for help, ask yourself if youâ€™ve really explored all the possibilities.
